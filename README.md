## What is it?

Password Generator is a simple application made in Java with Swing & Maven.

## What are the differences between the others?

- A small & simple application with a modern interface

- Lets you input ANY length you want

- Uses my own [Password Generator Library](https://github.com/Hedreon/PasswordGenerator/tree/main/src/main/java/com/hedreon/passwordgenerator/lib) (that anyone can use in their projects)

# Password Generator - Launch

This is the main code for launching the app.

## What does it do?

Inside the [`Main.java`](https://github.com/Hedreon/PasswordGenerator/blob/main/src/main/java/com/hedreon/passwordgenerator/Main.java) class, the `main()` method handles the launch process and sets up the look and feel before the UI gets created.

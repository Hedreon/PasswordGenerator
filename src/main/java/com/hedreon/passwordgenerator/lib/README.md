# Password Generator Backend / Password Generator Library

The Password Generator Library/Backend is a public library that anyone can use in their projects that generates a password from a specified length.

### Parameters

**(*)** = REQUIRED

- `JTextField` inputTextField - Specify the text field for the input (In this case, the length) **(*)**

- `JTextField` outputTextField - Specify the text field for the output (In this case, the password) **(*)**

## Code (In words):

### [`Generator.java`](https://github.com/Hedreon/PasswordGenerator/blob/main/src/main/java/com/hedreon/passwordgenerator/lib/Generator.java)

From package, `com.hedreon.passwordgenerator.lib`, import the following:

- Generator Constants
- `JTextField`

Make a class called `Generator` & make a function called `generate` & `copy`. Inside the `generate` function, get the specified length of the password & get String Builder. For integer is 0; integer is less than the specified password length; increment each time. `Random` is an integer, multiply 4 by X while X is random.

Switch cases to `Random`:
- Case #0: Append the password to an integer and multiply 10 by X while X is random.
- Case #1: `Random` is an integer, multiply the length of the alphabet in all lower case using the `LOWER_CASE` constant by X while X is random. After that, append the password to the chosen letter of the lower case alphabet.
- Case #2: `Random` is an integer, multiply the length of the alphabet in all upper case using the `UPPER_CASE` constant by X while X is random. After that, append the password to the chosen letter of the upper case alphabet.
- Case #3: `Random` is an integer, multiply the length of the `SYMBOLS` constant by X while X is random. After that, append the password to the chosen symbol.

After all that is done, set the text of the specified output text field to the final result in [Strings.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science))

### [`GeneratorConstants.java`](https://github.com/Hedreon/PasswordGenerator/blob/main/src/main/java/com/hedreon/passwordgenerator/lib/GeneratorConstants.java)

From package, `com.hedreon.passwordgenerator.lib`, make a class called `GeneratorConstants`. Inside the `GeneratorConstants` class, make a string on the lower case and upper case alphabet, and make a string on all the allowed symbols.
